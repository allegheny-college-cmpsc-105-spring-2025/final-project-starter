Ensure the CSV filename containing your data is final_project_data.csv and located in the data directory.\n\n\nSaving\nI would recommend a workflow of Copy to Drive --&gt; editing/running/testing --&gt; downloading. You should have already hit Copy to Drive, but if you haven’t, then please do so now. Then go ahead and download the file from the menu at the top of the Colab interface. File &gt; Download &gt; Download ipynb\n\n\nAccessibility Part 2\nIf you are satisfied with your work, you can now upload the downloaded file to your GitHub repo!\n\nUse GitHub to upload the file.\n\nNext to the green code button in GitHub, you will see an add file button. Click that, then choose the downloaded notebook from your computer."
